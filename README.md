# expense tracker app

This is an expense tracker app which tracks all your expenses under 4 categories, Leisure, Work, Food and Travel. It also shows a chart on the main screen showing which category had the most expense

It has an overlay screen where you can add a new expense

I learnt about theming and how to change between light and dark modes

I also learnt about building a responsive UI and how to render widgets according to the orientation and size of the screen

And finally, I added the option to slide and delete expenses which also promts a small alert message which has a small 'undo' button which automatically brings back the deleted expense
